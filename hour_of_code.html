            On Tuesday, November 15, our team number 27 (Jamila Gasimova, Nihat Zeynalov, Bakhtiar Guluzade, and Garib Guluzade) held an «Hour of Code» event for 10th-grade students of Baku School No 158 in Yasamal at 8.00 am. This class started with an ADA university introduction and was followed by explaining the basics of coding through the studio.code.org website to 20 students. In the beginning, on the projector, the head tutor Bakhtiar introduced our university by presentation in which Jamila changed the visual parts of the ADA-SITE production to engage students. However, the content was the same. Next, he showed several examples of puzzles and clarified them to the participants while Jamila took photos or videos. After that, students started working on their own at the computers while Bakhtar and other team members, Nihat, Garib, and Jamila, provided support by helping individual students. At the end of the event, participants successfully finished all tasks with certificates provided by studio.code.org.
